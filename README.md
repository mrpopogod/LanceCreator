# LanceCreator
Utility to create lances given an input file of possible mechs to use for building and your desired lance parameters (bv range, number of mechs).  Runs on the command line.  The pre-provided json files are populated with all currently available CGL plastic models and most variants for each one (anything involving C3 is a notable absence).  *_premium.json variants are ones that have premium record sheets available.
